**Aerosol** is a Chrome extension that visualizes air pollution in a way everyone understands - cigarettes!

## 🤔 What's This All About?

Ever wondered how bad the air pollution in your city really is? Air Quality Index (AQI) numbers can be abstract and hard to grasp. **Aerosol** translates these numbers into something more tangible - the equivalent number of cigarettes you're "smoking" just by breathing the air.
